Logically, the dead keratin shaft cannot signal the living follicle deep in the dermis to change its growth rate or thickness.</p></div><div id=\"origin-card\"><p>This is a timeless myth, likely arising from the blunt feel of cut hair tips. It feels coarser than the tapered natural tip, creating an illusion of thickness. The belief has persisted for nearly a century despite clinical debunking.</p></div><div id=\"context-card\"><p>The wording is neutral and inquiring. This is often spread by parents or peers as conventional wisdom.

The reaction is logically triggered by the movement of the cape, not the hue.</p></div><div id=\"origin-card\"><p>This is a cultural misconception derived from Spanish bullfighting imagery.

Physically, tall structures (like the Empire State Building) are struck dozens of times a year.

The unevenness is due to the crown glass usage method of manufacturing, not flow over time.</p></div><div id=\"origin-card\"><p>This is a persistent academic myth, often taught in schools.

Biologically, color change is primarily for temperature regulation (thermoregulation) and social signaling (mood, aggression, mating). Camouflage is a secondary, often accidental, benefit.</p></div><div id=\"origin-card\"><p>This is a popular cultural trope found in cartoons and fables. It simplifies complex ethology into a single \"superpower.\" Aristotle hinted at this, but modern pop culture cemented it.</p></div><div id=\"context-card\"><p>The tone is fascinated.
